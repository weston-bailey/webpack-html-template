# 📦 Webpack-Babel Vanilla Html Boilerplate

This is template code to serve up a vanilla html website using node.js and webpack and babel.  The advantage being modules and all nodejs features are easily supported and are transpiled to vanilla js. Express is used to serve the static build files.

## Getting started

* fork and clone this repo
* cd into the directory and run `npm i` to download the required packages
* use `npm run dev` to build and serve the application *NOTE: you will need re-run `npm run dev` to see your changes reflected in the browser*
* Navigate to `localhost:3000` to see the site
* use `npm run test-watch ./tests/module.test.js` to run the unit tests
  
> `./src` contains dev code and the output of webpack can be found in `./dist`

---

#### The following scripts can be run from the `package.json`

`npm run build` 

>  builds the `./src` directory to the `./dist` directory.

`npm run dev`

> builds and serves the application on `localhost:3000` using the express server found in `./index.js`

`npm run start`

> uses `nodemon` to rebuild the application on the on file changes

`npm run test < file name >` 

> runs any tests found in the file

`npm run test-watch < file name >` 

> runs any tests found in the file and reruns with nodemon on file changes

`npm run test-all` 

> runs all tests found with the filenameing convention `fileName.test.extension`

## Dependencies 

* [webpack](https://webpack.js.org/) -- used to bundle the website together
* [webpack-cli](https://webpack.js.org/api/cli/) -- used to build the website
* [webpack-html-plugin](https://webpack.js.org/plugins/html-webpack-plugin/) -- webpack plugin for building vanilla html sites
* [css-loader (webpack)](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/css-loader/) -- webpack plugin for loading vanilla css
* [style-loader (webpack)](https://webpack.js.org/loaders/style-loader/) -- webpack plugin for loading vanilla css
* [babel](https://babeljs.io/) -- complies the js to ECMAscript 5
* [nodemon](https://www.npmjs.com/package/nodemon) -- file watch utility that re-runs scripts when files change
* [mocha](https://mochajs.org/) -- for running unit tests
* [chai](https://www.chaijs.com/) -- assertion library for testing

## Notes

none right now 

## Todos

* write a script to both watch and serve, so the project can be rebuilt on save
* add testing to the express server
